        of certified cars along with smooth and convenient home delivery facilities with the click of a button.

        the startup, CARS24 can display the accurate market price and the appraisal value of the vehicle.

        CARS24 is an ISO 9001:2015 certified company and one of the fastest-growing used car marketplaces in India. CARS24 is the first company in the used-car industry that brought a 
        'transaction led' approach to selling a car. With this portal, a potential car owner can easily sell their car privately with the utmost security in less than 2 hours and get 
        paid instantly. While on the other end, CARS24 has thousands of used car businesses that buy these cars online via mobile auctions from these potential car owners across India.

        The company, though just 6 years old, has become highly sought-after due to the demand of the supply-side conducting over 100,000 transactions a year. CARS24 buys all these cars
        from more than 15 cities across the country and sells them to over 100 cities in India. The company's unique C2B model has helped it to leapfrog the existing C2C and B2C models 
        obstructively.

        <h1>Startup Story</h1>
        Building this empire on its unique advantages, CARS24 dominates the used car ecosystem that includes sectors such as financial services, and information services. Apart from dealing 
        in used cars online, CARS24 also has an offline presence in terms of brick and mortar stores, with more than 155 branches in over 35 cities in India.

        CARS24 is disrupting the pre-owned car industry in India and addressing the challenges faced by car owners, by providing them with a world-class customer experience that is quick, easy,
        and hassle-free.

        CARS24 also received an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for its new entity — CARS24 Financial Services. With Cars24 Financial Services, the company will facilitate 
        vehicle loans to customers as well as finance channel partners to help them expand their businesses. The customers will be eligible for a credit based on the car value they are buying. 
        For consumers, the average ticket size of a loan would be INR 2.5 Lakh - INR 3 Lakh.
        CARS24 - Industry The used car market in India was valued at $27 billion in 2020 and will probably reach around $50 billion by 2026. This is an industry that hardly had to face any 
        after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAGR of the industry has been registered at 15% during the period between 2021 and 2026.
        CARS24 - Startup Story On scanning the used cars industry, the founders quickly discovered that the industry was in utter chaos. Besides, the industry is full of loopholes that went 
        unmended from the very beginning.  A standard procedure is thus, totally absent when it comes to selling or purchasing a used car. Furthermore, the industry was also devoid of any 
        technological advancements that would help in the pricing of the used cars and ultimately prove to be a boon. Another obstacle related to the used cars market is in finding access 
        to the potential users without bumping into jumbled market players who aren't aware of a detailed appraisal of the car. Therefore, after a keen observation of the discrepancies in 
        the market, the founders of CARS24 decided to come up with a technology that would help resolve these issues and simplify the process of purchasing and selling used cars online.

        <h1>Mission and Vision</h1>
        "Our mission is to revolutionise the way used cars are bought and sold across the world", says the mission statement of the company.
        The vision of the company is to revolutionize the way used cars are sold by coming up with an efficient and reliable way for car owners to sell used cars at a reasonable price.
        
        CARS24 - Name, Tagline and Logo
        Though CARS24 hasn't disclosed a naming story, the name CARS24 has probably come from their idea of emerging as a 24/7 car buying and selling platform.
